	<h1>Challenge 2: Avoiding Nominalizations</h1>
 
	<h2>Your Goal</h2>
	<p>Avoid nominalizations to make the tone more certain and direct</p>

	<h2>Avoiding Nominalizations</h2>

	<h3>1. Not protecting the person or thing associated with the negativity in negative situations</h3>

	<h4>More Protection:</h4>
	<p>Let us know if there are issues with the activity’s
	usability.</p>

	<h4>Less Protection:</h4>
	<p>Let us know if the activities are not working properly.</p>

	<h3>2. Being certain or direct or showing emphasis</h3>

	<h4>Less Certain:</h4>
	<p>In this activity, your goal is to sound more direct.</p>

	<h4>More Certain:</h4>
	<p>In this activity, you aim to sound more direct.</p>
	
	<h4>Less Emphasis:</h4>
	<p>It did not take a lot of time for one student to get
	through the activities.</p>

	<h4>More Emphasis:</h4>
	<p>One student went through the activities quickly.</p>


	<h2>Feedback on Response Options</h2>

	<h3>Option A</h3>
	<p>"The user reported that pop up ads, promoting in-game
	products, were clogging many of the screens."</p>

	<p>This option untangles some nominalizations to highlight the
	customer’s experience, which also places the most emphasis the
	pop up ad issue. This would be appropriate if your purpose is
	to quickly get to your point.</p>


	<h3>Option B</h3>
	<p>"The user reported that many of the screens were clogged
	with popup ads that were promoting in-game products."</p>

	<p>This option untangles nominalizations to identify this
	report as a customer’s experience and directly describe the
	pop up ad issue. This option is slightly less direct than the
	first option, but would help you get to your point
	quickly.</p>


	<h3>Option C</h3>
	<p>"The user’s report noted that pop up ads, supporting the
	promotion of in-game products, were clogging the screens"</p>

	<p>This option keeps nominalizations that make it the least
	direct description of the problem. It takes the emphasis off
	of the customer’s experience itself and the purpose of the pop
	up ads. This would work well in a context where you are not
	describing an issue that needs to be focused on.</p>
