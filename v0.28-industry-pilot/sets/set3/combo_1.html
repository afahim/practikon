	<h1>Challenge 4: Combining Parallelism and Concision </h1>

	<h2>Your Goals</h2>
	<p>1. make related parts of the text <span class="highlighted">consistent</span> </p>
	<p>2. <span class="highlighted"> cutting </span> out unnecessary (already known, implied or repeated information) </p>

	<h2>Comments on Response Options</h2>

	<h3>Problem Text</h3>
	<p>This devise gem  <span class="problem">is the gem responsible for user
	authentication and functions related to that. It is rack-based
	and is used well with Rails application software.</span></p>

	
	<h3>Option A</h3>

	<p>“is responsible for user authentication and
	related functions. It is rack-based and compatible with Rails
	application software.” </p>

	<p>This option consistently describes this gem using related
	description words “rack-based” and “compatible.” It also cuts
	out repeated information such as “the gem[gem is the gem]” and
	implied information such as “related to that [functions
	related to that].” Replacing “used well” with “compatible”
	mentioned previously, also cuts out unnecessary
	information.</p>
	
	<h3>Option B</h3>

	<p>“is responsible for user authentication and
	related functions. It is rack-based and works with Rails
	application software.” </p>

	<p>This option, like the one above, cuts out repeated
	information such as “the gem [gem is the gem]” and implied
	information such as “related to that [functions related to
	that].” But, this option does not consistently describe this
	gem because it uses a description word, “rack-based” and the
	action word, “works” instead of using consistent description
	or action words. </p>
	
	<h3>Option C</h3>

	<p>“is the one responsible for user
	authentication and related functions. It is rack-based and a
	compatible partner with Rails application software.” </p>

	<p>This option, like the one above, does not consistently
	describe the gem because it uses a description word,
	“rack-based” and a thing, “partner,” instead of using
	consistent description words or action words. This option also
	adds implied information such as “the one [gem is the one].”
	Also, adding “a compatible partner” after the description word
	as previously mentioned, is less concise than adding another
	description word like “compatible.”</p>
