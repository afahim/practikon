	did not find the proposal confident or convincing enough. In the
	<span class="highlighted">challenges</span> that follow, try to

	<h1>Challenge 4: Combining Metadiscourse with Nominalizations</h1>

	<h2>Your Goals</h2>
	<p>1. Use intensifiers and/or remove hedgers to make the tone more confident</p>
	<p>2. Avoid nominalizations to make the tone more certain and direct</p>

	
	<h2>Feedback on Response Options</h2>

	<h3>Option A</h3>

	<p>"This proposal seeks to develop an online version of this
	environment, so that teams can conveniently collaborate after
	meetings, even from different parts of the world"</p>

	<p>This is a great option that untangles a couple of
	nominalizations, which highlights the purpose of the
	proposal. It also uses an intensifier (“even”) to emphasize
	the convenience of this system.  This works well when your
	purpose is to quickly make your point.</p>


	<h3>Option B</h3>

	<p>"This proposal seeks to develop an online version of this
	environment, so that teams have the chance to conveniently
	collaborate after meetings, even from different parts of the
	world."</p>

	<p>This option also untangles a nominalization, which
	highlights the general purpose of the proposal, and uses an
	intensifier (“even”) to emphasize the convenience of the
	system. However, it uses a nominalization (‘have the chance”)
	that makes the argument for using this system less certain or
	confident. This would be more appropriate in a context where
	your purpose is not to persuade people.</p>


	<h3>Option C</h3>

	<p>This proposal seeks to develop an online version of this
	environment, so that after meetings, there is a possibility
	that teams can continue their collaboration from different
	parts of the world.</p>

	<p>This option also untangles a nominalization, which
	highlights the general purpose of the proposal. However it
	uses a nominalization (“there is a possibility), which makes
	the argument sound less certain or convincing than the second
	option. This would only work in a context where your purpose
	is not to persuade people.</p>
