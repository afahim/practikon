	<h1>Challenge 4: Combining Metadiscourse, Nominalizations, and Concision</h1>

	<h2>Your Goals</h2>
	<p>1. Make <span class="highlighted">comments</span> showing
	<span class="highlighted">descriptions</span> and <span
	class="highlighted">connections</span>, and showing <span
	class="highlighted">degrees of certainty and
	directness</span></p>
	
	<p>2. <span class="highlighted">Avoiding</span> some nominalizations</p>
	
	<p>3. <span class="highlighted">Cutting out</span> unnecessary
	(already-known, implied or repeated) information</p>


	<h2>Comments on Response Options</h2>

	<h3>Problem Text</h3>
	<p>Pop up ads could also cause users an issue with security:
	<span class="problem">the pop up ads have the intention of getting users purchase
	their in-game products; if users click “yes,” purchases could
	be made without their confirmation,</span> since each player’s
	credit card information is already in the system.</p>


	<h3>Option A</h3>
	<p>"they could unintentionally make credit card purchases by
	accidentally clicking “yes”  on a pop up ad,"</p>

	<p>This option is concise, untangles some nominalizations, and
	uses descriptive comments (“unintentionally” and
	“accidentally”) to highlight the consequences of the problem
	with pop up ads. This option is appropriate if your purpose is
	to emphasize this.</p>


	<h3>Option B</h3>

	<p>"accidentally clicking “yes,” on a pop up ad could mean
	making unintentional credit card purchases without their
	confirmation"</p>

	<p>This option is slightly less concise, uses slightly more
	metadiscourse (descriptive comments), and untangles some
	nominalizations. By placing the “clicking yes” warning at the
	beginning, more emphasis is placed on this  warning. It also
	mentions “without their confirmation,” which places more
	emphasis on the consequences of the problem than the first
	option. This would be more appropriate if your purpose is to
	emphasize the severity of this issue.</p>


	<h3>Option C</h3>

	<p>"accidentally clicking “yes” on an ad could mean agreeing
	to purchase one of the in-game products without their
	confirmation."</p>

	<p>This option is similar to the other two options but it is
	slightly less concise; it reminds readers of the type of
	purchases made (“in-game products”). This would be more
	appropriate for audiences more familiar with pop up ads.</p>
