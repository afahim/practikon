	<h1>Challenge 3:Using Correctness </h1>

	<h2>Your Goal:</h2>
	<p>Use punctuation to create <span class="highlighted">breaks</span> between information </p>

	<h2>Punctuation Types </h2>

	<h3>Comma (,) </h3>
	<h4>1. Creates pauses in your messages, separating ideas and sentences </h4>
	<p>Example: As you are going through this activity<span class="highlighted">, </span> you will see how correctness markers are used. </p>

	<h4>2. Identifies information within a sentence which needs to be offset </h4>
	<p>Example: Some response options may work for audiences who pay attention to different aspects of your text. Other options<span class="highlighted">, however,</span> work well for different audiences. </p>

	<h3>Semi Colon (;) </h3>
	<h4>1. Connects related information but making sure each piece is separate. </h4>
	<p>Example: This activity focuses on correctness <span class="highlighted">;</span> other activities focus on different skills. </p>

	<h4>2. Enhances the distinction between the ideas in two sentences when it is placed before transitions ("however," therefore," for example" etc.) </h4>
	<p>Example: Three types of punctuation are shown here <span class="highlighted">;however,</span> only one is most appropriate for this activity. </p>

	<h3>Colon (:) </h3>
	<h4>1. Introduces a series </h4>
	<p>Example: This guide presents the following information about Correctness<span class="highlighted">:</span> different purposes of punctuation, examples, and feedback on the activity's response options. </p>

	<h4>2. Calls attention to an idea by explaining it further </h4>
	<p>Example: After the Coherence and Concision activities, there was one last skill to look at<span class="highlighted">:</span>: Correctness. </p>

	<p>Note about the Colon:Different from the colon, the dash ("-") signals a more causal afterthought. </p>

	<p>Example: The activities took a few minutes to get through<span class="highlighted">-</span> much less time than anticipated.</p>

	<h2>Feedback on Response Options </h2>

	<h3>Option A:</h3> 
	<p>“users: conference managers” </p>
 
	<p>This is the most effective punctuation marker if we intend to introduce the idea of a series of users. This would help an audience who may want to notice the types of users mentioned. </p>

	<h3>Option B:</h3> 
	<h4>“users, the conference managers” </h4>
	<p>For this type of report, a comma is the most informal punctuation marker. However, it could be appropriate for a less formal report or an email. </p>

	<h3>Option C:</h3>
	<h4>“users; conference managers” </h4>
	<p>The semicolon is the strongest punctuation marker, but it causes a disconnects between the pieces of information. This could still work well, though, for an audience whose main focus is not  the types of users mentioned.</p>
