	<h1>Challenge 4: Combining Nominalizations, Metadiscourse and Concision</h1>

	<h2>Your Goals</h2>
	<p>1. <span class="highlighted">reducing the clarity</span>  of a situation or <span class="highlighted">softening</span> the negativity!</p>
	<p>2. using hedgers and/or removing intensifiers to <span class="highlighted">soften</span> the tone</p>
	<p>3. <span class="highlighted">cutting out</span> unnecessary (already known, implied or repeated) information</p>


	<h2>Comments on Response Options</h2>

	<h3>Problem Text</h3>
	<p>Teams often had issues with their <span class="problem">colleagues cancelling
	Skype meetings, and they were becoming confused from keeping
	track of every single email</span> outside of meetings.</p>


	<h3>Option A</h3>

	<p>"cancellations of Skype meetings and
	the confusion from communicating mostly through email."</p>

	<p>This option is concise and uses nominalizations to soften
	the tone and place less emphasis on the team’s issues. It is
	appropriate if your purpose is to describe the problem
	politely without pointing blame.</p>


	<h3>Option B</h3>

	<p>"frequent cancellations of Skype
	meetings and the constant confusion from tracking every
	email."</p>

	<p>This option is also concise and also uses nominalizations,
	but some of its metadiscourse (“frequent, constant, every,”)
	also adds a more intense tone than the first option. It would
	be more appropriate if you are trying to remain polite, but
	still make your point.</p>


	<h3>Option C</h3>

	<p>“complaints of colleagues’  frequent cancellations of Skype
	meetings and the constant confusion from tracking every single
	email.”</p>
		
	<p>This option is also concise and uses nominalizations, but
	makes the smallest effort to soften the tone and avoid
	blame. It uses an intensifier (“complaint”) which immediately
	identifies the problem as a “complaint.” It also adds more
	intensifiers than the second option which intensifies the tone
	most. This would only work well in a context where you had to
	make your point quickly and felt no reason to avoid blame.</p>
