	<h1>Challenge 1: Using Metadiscourse</h1>

	<h2>Your Goal:</h2>
	<p>Make comments that guide the audience through the text</p>


	<h2>Types of Commenting</h2>
	
	<h3>1. Using hedgers or intensifiers to show confidence/certainty/directness etc.</h3>

	<h4>Hedgers:</h4>
	<p>The type of metadiscourse used sometimes depends on your context and audience.</p>

	<h4>Intensifiers/Removing intensifiers:</h4>
	<p>The type of metadiscourse used depends on your context and audience.</p>


	<h3>2. Descriptive Comments Besides Hedgers and Intensifiers</h3>

	<h4>Less Specific Description:</h4>
	<p>I started becoming addicted to these activities.</p>

	<h4>More Specific Description:</h4>
	<p>As I was going through the first few activities, I started becoming addicted to them.</p>


	<h3>3. Connecting Old and New ideas</h3>

	<h4>Less Direct Connections:</h4>
	<p>One purpose of metadiscourse is to show certainty. It can show connections between old and new ideas as well.</p>
 
	<h4>More Direct Connections:</h4>
	<p>One purpose of metadiscourse is to show certainty, and another is to show connections between old and new ideas.</p>


	<h2>Feedback on Response Options</h2>

	<h3>Option A</h3>

	<p>"The user made a report that many games had issues with
	usability, especially with clogged screens from pop up ads
	promoting in-game products."</p>

	<p>This option uses a descriptive comment (“user made a
	report”) to identify who the information belongs to. It also
	uses an intensifier (“especially”) and the phrase “issues with
	usability” to highlight the pop up ad issue. This would be
	appropriate if your purpose is to highlight this issue.</p>


	<h3>Option B</h3>

	<p>"The user made a report that many games had usability
	issues, such as clogged screens from pop up ads that were
	promoting in-game products."</p>
	
	<p>This option also clarifies that the user reported this
	information. It uses the phrase “usability issues” and a
	connecting comment (“such as”) that places less emphasis on
	the issue. This would work well if your purpose here is to
	describe an issue without emphasizing it.</p>


	<h3>Option C</h3>

	<p>"Many games had usability issues; the main issue was that
	the game screens were clogged with pop up ads promoting
	in-game products."</p>

	<p>This option does not make it clear that this information came
	from a user. It uses an intensifier (“main”) to highlight the
	issue with pop up ads. This would be appropriate if your
	purpose is to highlight  this issue in documents where you are
	not reporting customer experiences. </p>
