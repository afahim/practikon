	<h1>Challenge 2: Using Metadiscourse</h1>


	<h2>Your Goal</h2>
	<p>Using hedgers and/or removing intensifiers to <span class="highlighted">soften</span> the tone</p>


	<h2>Using Hedgers and/or Removing Intensifiers</h2>

	<p>1. Describing negative situations where your purpose is to <span class="highlighted">protect</span> the person or thing associated with the negativity (may mean more polite)</p>

	<h3>Less Protection</h3>
	<p>The guides <span class="highlighted">have</span> too much information to fit on a mobile
	  screen.</p>

	<h3>More Protection</h3>
	<p>The guides <span class="highlighted">may have</span> too much information to fit on a mobile
	  screen.</p>
	
	<p>2. Being <span class="highlighted">less certain</span> or direct or showing <span class="highlighted">less emphasis</span> (may mean more polite)</p>

	<h3>Less Certain/Direct</h3>
	<p>Going through the activities may take <span class="highlighted">a lot</span> of time.</p>

	<h3>More Certain/Direct</h3>
	<p>Going through the activities may take some time.</p>


	<h2>Comments on Response Options</h2>

	<h3>Problem Text</h3>
	<p>Although the teams were managing to meet on Skype each week
	despite their location’s time difference, <span class="problem">these meetings were
	finishing, even without a plan</span> for the next steps of the
	project.</p>


	<h3>Option A</h3>
	<p>"some of these meetings were finishing without a plan for"</p>

	<p>This option makes the most effort to soften the tone. It adds
	a hedger (“some”)and removes an intensifier (“even”) to place
	less emphasis on the problem. It would be appropriate for
	contexts where you want to politely describe a problem without
	pointing blame.</p>

	<h3>Option B</h3>
	<p>"these meetings were usually finishing without a
	plan for"</p>

	<p>This option removes an intensifier (“even”) to soften parts of
	the tone. However, it also uses an intensifier (“usually),
	which does make as much of an effort to soften the tone as the
	first option.  This would be appropriate if you had to get to
	your point quickly and felt no reason to protect your
	team.</p>

	<h3>Option C</h3>
	<p>"these meetings were unfortunately finishing, even without a plan"</p>

	<p>This option uses a stronger intensifier (“unfortunately”) than
	the second option, which does not make an effort to soften the
	tone. Instead, it emphasizes the problem. This would only work
	if you had to make your point quickly and felt no reason to
	protect your team. </p>
