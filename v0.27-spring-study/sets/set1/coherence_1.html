	      <h1>Challenge 1: Being Coherent</h1>

	      <h2>Your Goal</h2>

	      <span class="highlighted">Connecting</span> old
	      information with new information in a seamless
	      manner
	      
	      <h2>Coherence Example</h2>
	      
	      <h3>Less Coherent</h3>

	      <p>“Coherence connects old information with new
	      information. Concision cuts out unnecessary
	      information.”</p>

	      <h3>More Coherent</h3>

	      <p>“Coherence connects old information with new
	      information.  <span class="highlighted">Unlike
	      Coherence,</span>concision cuts out unnecessary
	      information.”</p>

	      <h2>Comments on Response Options</h2>

	      <h3>Problem Text</h3>

	      <p>I plan to receive my B.S. in Computer Science
	      from <span class="problem">Carnegie Mellon. The university that is leading
	      in Computer science contributed</span> to the quality of my
	      education and my value of teamwork.</p>

	      <h3>Option A</h3>

	      <p>“Carnegie Mellon, the
	      university that is leading in Computer Science, which
	      contributed” </p> 

	      <p>This option is better than the
	      original one because it immediately assigns to the
	      already-known university name an additional quality
	      (“leading”) which is important for the readers. This is
	      a great option if your audience is less familiar with
	      the university, or if your purpose is to place emphasis
	      on praising the university for an audience more familiar
	      with it. However, the sentence becomes very long with
	      the addition of the second dependent clause (“which
	      contributed…”)</p>

	      <h3>Option B</h3>

	      <p>“Carnegie Mellon. This university, a
	      leader in Computer Science, contributed”</p>

	      <p>This option is also good because it also connects the
	      already-known university name to its newly known title
	      (“leading”); however, the connection is not as immediate
	      as in the previous option, since it relies only on the
	      pronoun (“this”). This option would work well if your
	      audience is more familiar with the university, or if
	      your purpose is not to emphasize this title.</p>

	      <h3>Option C</h3> 

	      <p>“Carnegie Mellon. It is the leading
	      university in Computer Science and contributed”</p>

	      <p>This option uses a pronoun (“It”) to connect the
	      already-known university name to its title
	      (“leading”). The connection between the two sentences is
	      not very clear; this option may work only if you need to
	      present information in small chunks, especially for
	      audience reading the text very quickly.</p>
