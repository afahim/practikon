	The following section presents excerpts from an<span class="highlighted"> Executive Summary </span> of a <span class="highlighted">Final Technical Report</span> on a new conference registration system created by a software development team in Qatar. The developers believe that the innovative features of their new system make it superior to its competitors. However, their clients (the Qatar National Convention Center) did not find the Executive Summary and Report convincing enough. In the <span class="highlighted">challenges</span> that follow, try to consider the options presented so that the developers can make the most effective case for their audience. <br><br>Directions:  Identify and improve text that can make the report more effective, in terms of its  <span class="highlighted">parallelism</span>, <span class="highlighted">coherence</span>, and <span class="highlighted">concision</span>.

	<h1>Challenge 1: Being Concise </h1>

	<h2>Your Goal</h2>
	<p><span class="highlighted"> cutting out </span> unnecessary (already-known, implied or repeated) information. </p>

	<h2>Concision Example </h2>

	<h3>Less Concise</h3>

	<p>The <span class="highlighted">goal in having students
	complete this activity</span> is to
	show <span class="highlighted">them</span> how
	concision <span class="highlighted"> has the potential
	to</span> make communication more effective. </p>

	<h3>More Concise</h3>

	<p><span class="highlighted"> The purpose of this
	activity </span> is to show how
	concision <span class="highlighted"> can </span> make
	communication more effective. </p>
	
	<h2>Comments on Response Options</h2>

	<h3>Problem Text</h3>
	<p>Our client requested that our system include more functions
	that would upgrade it. We managed to <span class="problem">accomplish adding these
	new use cases, despite previous concerns about the ways in
	which we can meet our deadline</span> and to handle code defects
	discovered earlier.</p>

	<h3>Option A </h3>

	<p>“add these use cases, despite previous concerns about
	meeting our deadline” </p>
 
	<p>This option cuts out the most implied information such as
	“accomplish” and “the ways in which we can” and “our.” </p>

	<h3>Option B</h3>

	<p>“add these new use cases to the system, despite previous
	concerns about our ability to meet our deadline” </p>
 
	<p>Like the option above, this cuts out implied information
	such as “accomplish,” but it adds “our ability to,” which may
	be implied for some audiences. But because adding this
	emphasizes the effort in meeting the deadline, this option
	might work well if your purpose is to emphasize this.</p>
	

	<h3>Option C</h3>

	<p>“add these new use cases despite the fact there were
	previous concerns about our ability to meet our deadline” </p>
    
	<p>Like both options above, this cuts out “accomplish” which
	is implied, but it also adds implied information such as “the
	fact there were.” Like the option above, it adds “our ability
	to,” which aims to emphasize the effort in meeting the
	deadline, so this part of the option would work well if your
	purpose is to emphasize this effort. </p>
