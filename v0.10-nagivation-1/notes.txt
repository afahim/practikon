Stacie's Navigation Sketch

My Own Feedback:
1. Glare which comes when a non-problematic segment is selected should start with 100% darkness and then fade out to 50%, not the other way round like it currently is.
2. Very long choices tend to get cropped at the bottom. Figure out a way!

Firas's iPhone Feedback:
1. Hard to click replacement choice. Make whole swipeable clickable
