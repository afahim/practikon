	The following section presents excerpts from an<span class="highlighted"> Executive Summary </span> of a <span class="highlighted">Final Technical Report</span> on a new conference registration system created by a software development team in Qatar.

	<h1>Challenge 1: Being Concise </h1>

	<h2>Your Goals</h2>
	<p>1. connecting old and new information in a seamless manner</p>
	<p>2. making related parts of a text consistent</p>
	<p>3. cutting out unnecessary (already-known, repeated or implied) information</p>

	<h2>Concision Example </h2>

	<h3>More Concise</h3>

	<p>The <span class="highlighted">goal in having students
	complete this activity</span> is to
	show <span class="highlighted">them</span> how
	concision <span class="highlighted"> has the potential
	to</span> make communication more effective. </p>

	<h3>Less Concise</h3>

	<p><span class="highlighted"> The purpose of this
	activity </span> is to show how
	concision <span class="highlighted"> can </span> make
	communication more effective. </p>


	<h2>Comments on Response Options</h2>

	<h3>Problem Text</h3>
	<p>We want our client to understand that [all of the important
	and critical use cases have been implemented, and that the
	major issues that have risen have been addressed. Major issues
	have been documented and we have discussed them as well.] Most
	of these issues were caused by assumptions made during the
	early stages of the project. </p>


	<h3>Option A</h3>
	<p>“all critical use cases have been implemented, and major
	issues have been addressed, documented, and discussed.”</p>

	<p>This option directly connects the implementation of use
	cases with the approaches to issues. It uses parallel concepts
	to describe these approaches: “addressed,” “documented,”and
	“discussed.”</p>


	<h3>Option B</h3>
	<p>“every single critical use case has been implemented
	  and major issues have been addressed, documented, and
	  discussed.”</p>

	<p>Like the first option, this directly connects the
	implementation of use cases with the approaches to issues, and
	uses parallel concepts to describe these approaches. But, it
	is a little less concise because it adds “every single.” Using
	“every single,” though, emphasizes that all of the critical
	use cases have been issued; therefore, this option would work
	well if your purpose is  to emphasize this.</p>


	<h3>Option C</h3>
	<p>“all important and critical use cases have been
	implemented. Major issues have been addressed, and we have
	been documenting and are discussing them.”</p>

	<p>This makes no connection between the implementation of use
	cases with approaches to issues. Although the concepts,
	“documenting” and “discussing” are parallel, they are not
	parallel with “addressed.” Also, “we” and “are” are implied and
	therefore unnecessary.</p>
