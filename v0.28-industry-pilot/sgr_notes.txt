I've finished with set 1 through 4.

I am currently incorporating the latest content from Mollie's Google Drive docs. I have finished incorporating all the content elements, and the guides up to metadiscourse. Formatting is questionable, but I will worry about htat later.

So, I will need to start with Concision's Guide, and finish rest of the content.

2/9 notes

TOOD:

0. When the activity starts, the initial option is not the same as the one shown in the text. That's misleading...

1. Format the guide pages better

2. Reset the scores on the set_index.html page. (DONE)

3. Guide pages should not be cut off. (DONE)

.swipe-compartment {
  padding: 0.5em;
  background: white;
  font-size: 14pt;
  line-height:50px;
//  height: 35em !important; // this cuts off the page.
  min-height: 35em;
  color: white;
}

4. changed the guide/context buttons's highlighting scheme (DONE)
