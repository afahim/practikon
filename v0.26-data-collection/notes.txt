We are focusing on Coherence, Concision, Parallelism and Correctness

I'm adding meta tages to each activity type html page so that practikon.js can figure out which activity is being carried out.

Using images isn't good for us - we need to either use css based icons or png's to make load times faster. Can we get rid of the home page img and use an icon instead? I can find nice icons if Stacie can't.

navigation.css is now activity.css

ToDo's
